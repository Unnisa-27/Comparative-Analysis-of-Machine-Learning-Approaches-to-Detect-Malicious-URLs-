Dataset
The data collection phase involves gathering relevant dataset from sources that provide examples of both phishing and legitimate URLs. The dataset in this research was (obtained from the public online repository Mendeley) sourced from Kaggle, a platform known for
histing various datasets including those related to cybersecurity. The dataset (‘Pishing_Legitimate_full.csv’) contained 48 features extracted from 5000 phishing websites and 5000 real websites. The class label indicated two outcomes where 0 was a phishing website, and 1 was a real website.
