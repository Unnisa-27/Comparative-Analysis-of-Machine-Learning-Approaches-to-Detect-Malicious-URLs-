A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches to Detect Malicious URLs for Phishing Attack Prevention

Malicious URL attacks, often use duplicate websites and authentic logos to deceive users, which pose a significant threat in cyberspace, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information like bank details and passwords. Despite existing anti-phishing measures, attackers continuously evolve their tactics,highlighting the need for an effective prediction mechanism to protect users effectively. Classification is one of the techniques used to detect website phishing. This paper has proposed a model for detecting phishing attacks using various machine learning (ML) classifiers. Random Forest, CATB, and Na√Øve Bayes are used as the machine learning classifiers to train the proposed model.The dataset in this research was obtained from the public online repository Mendeley with 48 features are extracted from 5000 phishing websites and 5000 real websites. The model was analyzed using F1 scores, where both precision and recall evaluations are taken into consideration. The proposed work has concluded that the random forest classifier has achieved the most efficient and highest performance scoring with 98% accuracy.
